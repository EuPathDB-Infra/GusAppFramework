Oracle jars are provided by the Oracle Corporation http://www.oracle.com and
are subject to the following terms and licenses:

ORACLE TECHNOLOGY NETWORK 
DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE AGREEMENT


"We," "us," and "our" refers to Oracle USA, Inc., for and on behalf of itself 
and its subsidiaries and affiliates under common control.  "You" and "your" 
refers to the individual or entity that wishes to use the programs from Oracle.
"Programs" refers to the software product you wish to download and use and 
program documentation.  "License" refers to your right to use the programs
under the terms of this agreement.  This agreement is governed by the
substantive and procedural laws of California.  You and Oracle agree to submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the courts of San Francisco, 
San Mateo, or Santa Clara counties in California in any dispute arising out of
or relating to this agreement.

We are willing to license the programs to you only upon the condition that you
accept all of the terms contained in this agreement.  Read the terms carefully
and select the "Accept" button at the bottom of the page to confirm your
acceptance.  If you are not willing to be bound by these terms, select the 
"Do Not Accept" button and the registration process will not continue.

License Rights
We grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable limited license to use the 
programs for purposes of developing your applications.  You may also distribute 
the programs with your applications to your customers.  If you want to use the
programs for any purpose other than as expressly permitted under this agreement
you must contact us, or an Oracle reseller, to obtain the appropriate license.
We may audit your use of the programs.  Program documentation is either shipped
with the programs, or documentation may accessed online at
http://otn.oracle.com/docs.

Ownership and Restrictions
We retain all ownership and intellectual property rights in the programs.  You
may make a sufficient number of copies of the programs for the licensed use and
one copy of the programs for backup purposes.

You may not:
- use the programs for any purpose other than as provided above;
- distribute the programs unless accompanied with your applications;
- charge your end users for use of the programs;
- remove or modify any program markings or any notice of our proprietary rights;
- use the programs to provide third party training on the content and/or 
functionality of the programs, except for training your licensed users;
- assign this agreement or give the programs, program access or an interest in 
the programs to any individual or entity except as provided under this 
agreement;
- cause or permit reverse engineering (unless required by law for 
interoperability), disassembly or decompilation of the programs;
- disclose results of any program benchmark tests without our prior consent; or,
- use any Oracle name, trademark or logo.

Program Distribution
We grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable right to copy and distribute the 
programs to your end users provided that you do not charge your end users for 
use of the programs and provided your end users may only use the programs to 
run your applications for their business operations.  Prior to distributing 
the programs you shall require your end users to execute an agreement binding 
them to terms consistent with those contained in this section and the sections 
of this agreement entitled "License Rights," "Ownership and Restrictions," 
"Export," "Disclaimer of Warranties and Exclusive Remedies," "No Technical 
Support," "End of Agreement," "Relationship Between the Parties," and "Open 
Source." You must also include a provision stating that your end users shall 
have no right to distribute the programs, and a provision specifying us as a 
third party beneficiary of the agreement.  You are responsible for obtaining 
these agreements with your end users.  

You agree to:  (a) defend and indemnify us against all claims and damages 
caused by your distribution of the programs in breach of this agreements and/or 
failure to include the required contractual provisions in your end user 
agreement as stated above; (b) keep executed end user agreements and records 
of end user information including name, address, date of distribution and 
identity of programs distributed; (c) allow us to inspect your end user 
agreements and records upon request; and, (d) enforce the terms of your end 
user agreements so as to effect a timely cure of any end user breach, and to 
notify us of any breach of the terms.

Export
You agree that U.S. export control laws and other applicable export and import 
laws govern your use of the programs, including technical data; additional 
information can be found on Oracle's Global Trade Compliance web site located 
at http://www.oracle.com/products/export/index.html?content.html.  You agree 
that neither the programs nor any direct product thereof will be exported, 
directly, or indirectly, in violation of these laws, or will be used for any 
purpose prohibited by these laws including, without limitation, nuclear, 
chemical, or biological weapons proliferation.

Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies

THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  WE FURTHER 
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NONINFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA
USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR
TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  OUR 
ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND 
DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).

No Technical Support
Our technical support organization will not provide technical support, phone 
support, or updates to you for the programs licensed under this agreement.

Restricted Rights
If you distribute a license to the United States government, the programs, 
including documentation, shall be considered commercial computer software and 
you will place a legend, in addition to applicable copyright notices, on the 
documentation, and on the media label, substantially similar to the following:
NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS
"Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer 
software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including
documentation, shall be subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the 
applicable Oracle license agreement.  Otherwise, programs delivered subject to 
the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted computer software' and use,
duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be 
subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer 
Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987).  Oracle USA, Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway,
Redwood City, CA  94065."

End of Agreement
You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs.  
We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to 
comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy
all copies of the programs.

Relationship Between the Parties
The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor.  Neither 
party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any 
obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent 
the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity.  
Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to
independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to 
the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other 
party is not included in such software.

Open Source
"Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, 
modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the
user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any 
software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available
in source code form.  If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the 
programs, you must ensure that your use does not:  (i) create, or purport to 
create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, 
or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our 
intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs.  For 
example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an
Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains 
code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without
limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license 
that requires any "modifications" be made freely available.  You also may not 
combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public
License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or 
asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become
subject to the terms of the GPL.

Entire Agreement
You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and 
licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements
or representations.  If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or 
unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
