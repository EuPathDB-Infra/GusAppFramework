To use this tool doing the following under the project name:

1.  Open resources/application.properties and fill in the database access info, the prefix to use
    for the biomaterials graph html file and the location of the graphviz dot executable on this
    system.
2.  Run ant jar
3.  Run java -jar DB2BiomatGraph.jar <studyId>
4.  Three output files should appear.  Where StudyGraph has been selected as the prefix, the files
    would be StudyGraph_<studyId>.dot, StudyGraph_<studyId>.gif, and StudyGraph_<studyId>.html
5.  Open the StudyGraph_<studyId>.html file in any browser.

Note:  If logging and console output is too extensive, modify the resources/log4j.properties file
prior to step 2 above.

Note:  The html file depends of scripting and styling located in the css and js directories of this
project.  As such, the html file cannot be removed from this environment and still be expected to
function properly.
