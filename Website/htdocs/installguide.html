<h2>Installing GUS from Scratch</h2> 
<h3>September 15, 2003</h3>

This GUS documentation section details the steps in installing and initializing GUS
on a newly created Oracle database. The database may be empty. 
It is important to keep in mind that the GUS distribution and its
contents are under development -- occasionally a bug will slip through
testing but not slip through your installation undetected.  
<p>
The instructions outlined here are <i>general</i>. Experiences
to date with these instructions have found no system related issues.
A number of the steps outlined here and additional details
appear at the <a href="www.gusdb.org">GUS Platform Web Site</a> for 
<a href="http://www.gusdb.org/documentation/install-setup.html">setup notes</a> and 
<a href="http://www.gusdb.org/documentation/schema-setup.html">schema setup</a>.


<h3>1.0 &nbsp; Creating the Oracle Database</h3>
The GUS database may be created in Oracle using
the <tt><b>dbca</b></tt> utitlity. Select the data warehouse
option.  For other parameters the defaults
will work, but some parameters can clearly be changed 
for the better, such as percent memory utilization.
A report by Jessica Kissinger discusses database 
configuration.

<a name="createusers">
<h3>1.1 &nbsp; Creating Required GUS Users in Oracle</h3>
</a>
Assume now that a database has been created in Oracle, 
it is empty without tables and users, and has the
name <b>gus</b>.
Two GUS accounts must be created before going further in 
the installation. One account requires
<i>read/write</i> access to the database, and the other has only <i>read access</i>.
SQL to establish the accounts <b>gusrw</b> and 
<b>gusdevreadonly</b> is 
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp &nbsp;</td>
    <td>
       a. CREATE USER GUSRW IDENTIFIED BY <b>password</b> DEFAULT TABLESPACE users QUOTA 100M ON users;
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp</td>
    <td>
        b. CREATE USER GUSdevReadOnly IDENTIFIED BY <b>password</b> DEFAULT TABLESPACE users 
        QUOTA 100M ON users;
    </td>
   </tr>
</table>
where <b>password</b> should differ for the two accounts.

<p>
The accounts require privileges as provided by
the following SQL commands in the <a href="installguide01.sql">user initialization script</a>.
These commands grant privileges to the GUS accounts. The commands may
be placed in a script (say, <tt>userinit.sql</tt>) and executed 
at the SQLPLUS prompt as <tt>@userinit.sql</tt>.
This script is not part of the GUS distribution.

<a name="createtablespaces">
<h3>1.2 Creating GUS TableSpaces</h3>
<p>
In the next step <b>tablespaces</b> are created for the
GUS namespaces <tt>CORE</tt>, <tt>SRES</tt>, <tt>DoTS</tt>, <tt>TESS</tt> and <tt>RAD3</tt>, 
along with index tables for each. This can be accomplished with 
the SQL commands in the <a href="installguide02.sql">table initialization script</a>.
These commands create the relational tables for the GUS namespaces. 
This script is not part of the GUS distribution.

<a name="installgusdist">
<h3>2.0 Installing the GUS Distribution</h3>
</a>
<p>
This section  gives instructions to install the GUS distribution from 
the CVS repository distribution into <b>gus</b>, the Oracle database created above.
GUS installation includes the GUS schema, users, and
the CBIL distribution, also distributed with GUS.  The GUS installation
consists of a <i>source part</i> and an <i>executable part</i>.  
The source part is rooted in the directory called <b>$PROJECT_HOME</b>. 
Installation is performed from <b>$PROJECT_HOME</b>, with 
"executable GUS" going to <b>$GUS_HOME</b>. 
The installation is interrupted at a couple of places
to update parameter files in <b>$GUS_HOME</b>, 
as <a href=#buildinggus>discussed below in building GUS</a>.
First, there are some additional details to attend to.

<a name="shellenv">
<h3>2.1 Setting up your shell environment</h3>
</a>
<p>
The GUS distribution can be installed in any account, but it can be handy 
to dedicate an account for GUS installation and management. For example, 
a GUS development account and a GUS production account could be useful.
Each of account has its own Oracle database and Linux user account.
Key locations are pointed to by shell environment variables. 
<a href="installguide03.txt">This snippet from from a .tcshrc</a> 
script initializes the environment variables used by GUS. 
Note the requirements for <tt>Java</tt> and <tt>Ant</tt>. 
For further details about the use of these systems see the
<a href=http://www.gusdb.org>GUS Platform Web Site</a>.

<h3>2.2 Obtaining and installing the GUS distribution</h3>
<p>
The GUS distribution and required CBIL project distribution can 
be downloaded from the Sanger Institute.
The complete distributions can be obtained as three tarballs:
    <ul>
       <li><tt>gus.tar.gz</tt> and <tt>install.tar.gz</tt> from 
the <a href="http://cvsweb.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?hidenonreadable=1&f=h&logsort=date&hidecvsroot=1&sortby=file&hideattic=1&cvsroot=GUS">Sanger Institute GUS CVS root page</a>, and
       <li><tt>cbil.tar.gz</tt> from 
<a href="http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/downloads/CBIL/releases/">CBIL release</a> at the University of
Pennsylvania.
    </ul>
Note that the names of the tarballs can differ slightly from the generic
titles used here. See the <a href="http://www.gusdb.org">GUS Platform Site</a>  
for further details about tarball locations.

<p>
After <a href="#shellenv">setting up one's shell environment</a>,
one can readily unpack the tar files by executing: 
 <ul>
   <li> <tt> cd ${PROJECT_HOME}; zcat gus.tar.gz  &nbsp; |  &nbsp;  tar xvpf -</tt>
   <li> <tt> cd ${PROJECT_HOME}; zcat install.tar.gz  &nbsp; |  &nbsp;  tar xvpf -</tt>
   <li> <tt> cd ${PROJECT_HOME}; zcat cbil.tar.gz  &nbsp; |  &nbsp;  tar xvpf -</tt>
 </ul>

<h3>2.3 GUS properties file</h3>
The <tt>.gus.properties</tt> file defines database information
in your environment.  Pointed to by the environment variable
<tt>$GUS_CONFIG_FILE</tt>,
<tt>.gus.properties</tt> stores information pertaining to the two
Oracle databases: GUS read/write and GUS readonly. 
The contents of an operational <tt>.gus.properties</tt> file (minus the
actual passwords) is given below.
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; </td> 
<td>
<tt>
databaseLogin=GUSrw<br>
databasePassword=mydogsname<br>
readOnlyDatabaseLogin=GUSdevReadOnly<br>
readOnlyDatabasePassword=mycatsname<br>
coreSchemaName=Core<br>
userName=dba<br>
group=dba<br>
project=Database administration<br>
dbiDsn=dbi:Oracle:host=amrit.cs.uchicago.edu;sid=gus3<br>
</tt>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
One can establish the GUS properties from the sample with the GUS distribution:
<table><tr>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; </td> 
<td>
<tt>cp $PROJECT_HOME/install/gus.properties.sample $GUS_CONFIG_FILE</tt>
</td></tr></table>

<p>
The GUS properties file can be configured
by copying the sample file and editing the contents to indicate the
location of Perl on your system:
<table><tr>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; </td> 
<td>
<tt>cp $PROJECT_HOME/install/config/install.prop.sample $GUS_HOME/config/install.prop</tt>
</td></tr></table>

<a name="buildinggus">
<h3>2.4 Building GUS</h3>
</a>
<p>
Now one can instruct the build system to install both itself (the "install" project) 
and also to install the principal GUS project. There is a small workaround required though.
The script <tt>$PROJECT_HOME/GUS/build.xml</tt> references database tables prior to installation
of the Oracle tables, but the script that builds the tables scripts is {\tt build.xml}.
So, we make a two pass install of GUS by first removing the database accesses in
<tt>build.xml</tt>. These accesses occur in two places as of this writing in the
following build.xml code fragments (line numbers are given from the release as
of this writing) for <i>GUS object generation</i>:
<pre>
    116      &lang;exec executable="generateGusObjects"
    117             failonerror="true"&rang;
    118         &lang;arg value="--javaOrPerl=java"/&rang;
    119       &lang;/exec&rang;

    192       &lang;exec executable="generateGusObjects"
    193             failonerror="true"&rang;
    194         &lang;arg value="--javaOrPerl=perl"/&rang;
    195       &lang;exec&rang;
</pre>

<p>
Here is the build process with the work around. Note that three calls to 
<tt>build.xml</tt> are currently required.
<ol>
<li># remove <i>GUS object generation</i> from <tt>$PROJECT_HOME/GUS/build.xml</tt>
<li><b>gus_prompt></b> <tt>build GUS install -append</tt>
<li><b>gus_prompt></b> <tt>cp $GUS_HOME/config/schema.prop.sample $GUS_HOME/config/schema.prop</tt>
<li># edit properties in <tt>schema.prop</tt> such as the SID and passwords for namespaces
<li><b>gus_prompt></b> <tt>build GUS install -append</tt>
<li><b>gus_prompt></b> <tt>cd $GUS_HOME/schema/oracle; create-db.sh |& tee create-db.sh.out</tt>
<li># restore <i>GUS object generation</i> in <tt>$PROJECT_HOME/GUS/build.xml</tt>
<li><b>gus_prompt></b> <tt>build GUS install -append</tt>
</ol>
where <b>gus_prompt></b>  is the shell command line prompt, and lines beginning
with "#" describe a procedure to occur there.



<a name="gusinitial">
<h3>2.4 Initializing GUS Database Contents</h3>
</a>
The process of moving data into and out of GUS uses <i>plugins</i>.
Plugins are Perl modules registered with the GUS database 
by storing the plugin's version number and checksum, and other information. 
Plugins are always executed by the program <tt>ga</tt>:
<b>ga must be registered with the database before you can use GUS</b>. 
However, before
<tt>ga</tt> can be registered and GUS populated, there are several tables
that require values. 

<h3>2.5 Registering GUS namespace users</h3>
The <tt>.gus.properties</tt> file defines for GUS <tt>username</tt>, <tt>group</tt> and 
<tt>project</tt> entries. Whatever the definition of these entries in the properties
file, they must be in the <tt>Core.UserInfo</tt>, <tt>Core.GroupInfo</tt>, and 
<tt>Core.ProjectInfo</tt> tables.
During installation, GUS creates default values for these properties, so that one can
simply define the user, group and project in <tt>.gus.properties</tt> to be the same 
as the values established by the GUS installation, namely: 
<ul>
<li><tt>userName=dba</tt>
<li><tt>group=dba</tt>
<li><tt>project=Database administration</tt>.
</ul>
After registering <tt>ga</tt> and <tt>SubmitRow</tt> 
as described below for <a href="#garegister">ga registration</a>
and <a href="#submitrowregister">submitrow registration</a>,
one can use the plugins to make entries
in the <tt>Core.UserInfo</tt>, <tt>Core.GroupInfo</tt>, and <tt>Core.ProjectInfo</tt> 
tables for users, groups and projects at one's site; alternatively, one can use 
<tt>sqlplus</tt>
to directly access the tables in the database. The latter is to be avoided 
if possible since plugins conform to protocols for registering algorithms that modify 
GUS database tables. 

<h3>2.6 Populating the Machine Table</h3>
The <tt>Core.Machine</tt> table requires an entry that describes the machine where
GUS is running. The following line inserted into the <tt>Core.Machine</tt> table will
do the trick:
<pre>
insert into core.machine values(0, 'unknown', NULL, 1, 0, SYSDATE, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1);
</pre>
The attributes corresponding to the values for <tt>Core.Machine</tt> can be 
gleaned from the GUS schema browser.

<a name="garegister">
<h3>2.7 Registering <tt>ga</tt></h3>
</a>
<p>
The first step is to establish the plugin manager's property file.
This file just contains the location of <tt>md5sum</tt> 
(for calculating checksums of plugins) on your system.  
The following will establish this:

<ol>
<li><b>gus_prompt></b>  <tt>cp $GUS_HOME/config/GUS-PluginMgr.prop.sample $GUS_HOME/config/GUS-PluginMgr.prop</tt>
<li><b>gus_prompt></b>  # edit file to point to location of md5sum
</ol>
<tt>ga</tt> can now be registered with the command <tt><b>ga +meta --commit</b></tt>.


<a name="submitregister">
<h3>2.8 Registering the <tt>SubmitRow</tt> plugin</h3>
</a>
<p>
Now that GUS is initialized, we will perform a partial check of the database by
registering the broadly useful plugin <tt>SubmitRow</tt>. We use <tt>ga</tt> 
for this as follows
<pre>
   ga +create GUS::Common::Plugin::SubmitRow
       ... check output and if looks okay, commit.
   ga +create GUS::Common::Plugin::SubmitRow --commit
</pre>
The two stage approach for running <tt>ga</tt> allows one to check the output
for problems without committing the changes to the database. 


GUS basics are initialized at this point. 
This is a good point to look at some of the tables created in
the installation and initialization process. The next section 
tells how to populate other tables with information fundamental 
to GUS, for example the GO ontology, sequence types, and NCBIs taxonomy.
