         - Subviews:
            - typically fit into a table
            - have columns that contain specific data types, 
              which may be rendered accordingly, including specialized graphics
         - Links to other available view pages
  - Examples of subview
      - Sequence

        in perl and mouse overs controlled by java script)
      - alignment textual display
      - result set,including type-specific columns (eg, links)
      - another example of a type-specific column is a column of percent 
        values.  the view can be configured to show them as text or bargraph
        

  - ResultSets
     - these hold columns as described above
     - another example of this is the history display
