These are brief notes on a conversation between Angel, Steve and Terry Clark
about issues for parsing XML.

1. Computing sequence length.  [This should be done as an internal method on the Sequence object.]

2. Controlled vocabs:  transforming terms into the correct internal id.

3. Handling updates instead of inserts

4. Handling references

5. Handling a replace operation, ie, a delete followed by an insert

6. Offering alternate keys [?]

7. Read the database[?]
