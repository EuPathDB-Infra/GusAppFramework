Checkout and build:

1.  Do an svn checkout of https://www.cbil.upenn.edu/svn/cbil/MagetabConverter/
2.  cd Magetab2Xml/resources
3.  vi/eamcs resources and alter the properties according to platform and personal taste.
4.  cd ..
5.  ant jar

Run:

1.  To run the Magetab2Xml converter use the following command line (using Java 7):

    java -jar Magetab2Xml.jar <Excel MAGE-TAB file> -validate -graphml -html -prefix=<prefix> -dot=<dot_path> cp="."

2.  All output file will be in a new directory labeled <basename> where basename is the
    original file name without the xlsx extension.
3.  If this directory already exists, it will be emptied first.

4.  The output directory will consist of the following files:
    The idf text file:	 idf.txt
    The sdrf text file:	 sdrf.txt
    The xml output:      <filename>.xml
    The graphml file:    <filename>.graphml (only if the -graphml switch is set on the command line)
    The dot file:        <filename>.dot (only if the -html switch is set on the command line)
    The image file:      <filename>.gif (only if the -html switch is set on the command line)
    The html graph file: <filename>.html (only if the -html switch is set on the command line)
    The html zip file:   <filename>.zip (only if the -html switch is set on the command line)
    The <filename> is set in the application.properties file by default when not set on the command line.

5.  The log file will be in limpopo.log or limpopo.log.<date stamp>
6.  The html zip makes use of pre-zipped static files in htmlResources.zip, which is rebuilt with the
    ant build.
7.  The xsd file is output.xsd and is applied only if the -validate switch is set on the command line
8.  Note that limpopo sometimes throws UnsupportedOperationExceptions that don't interfere with processing.
    Nevertheless, check output carefully when those occur.

Notes about creating Excel spreadsheets with MAGE-TAB additions:

1.  The spreadsheet should still show a complete MAGE-TAB.
2.  Additions to the existing MAGE-TAB should be shown in yellow highlight.
    a.  Do not highlight MAGE-TAB headers (1st column of IDF, 1at row of SDRF).  Otherwise, an
        exception will be thrown.
    b.  The study title must be appended with a database id (<id=n>).
    c.  New study factors, protocols, contacts can be highlighted in the IDF.
    d.  Rows representing new expts. in the SDRF may be highlighted.
    e.  Column representing new steps in the SDRF may be highlighted.
    f.  If one or more splits/merges are added, do not highlight in yellow the cells that are
        common across all split/merged rows.  If this policy is not observed, no exception will
        be thrown.  Instead multiple unmerged rows will appear because the highlighting translates
        into a token <<add>> which will make the rows appear completely distinct to limpopo.
3.  The submitter is welcome to highlight other items in the spreadsheet in any color other than
    yellow.
    
    
Policies:

CBIL MAGE-TABS do stray from the official specification in some respects.  In order not to confuse limpopo, some
consideration must be given to placement of data:

1.  If one or more labs are contacts, they must be at the end of the contact list.  Othewise surnames and given
    names of the following contacts may be transposed.
