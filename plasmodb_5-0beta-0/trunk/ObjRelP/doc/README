Dependencies of the objects on specific implementations:
NOTE: Currently will work with Oracle (DBI must be installed) and
      likely Sybase although has not been tested since adding the
      Oracle bits.  Other dbms will need to be checked for...the sticker
      is getting meta information as each dbms seems to differ.

1.  Must have a TableInfo table.

2.  Must have all the "default" attributes in every table (modification_date to end).
    a.  these get set on submit 
    b.  read/write bits checked when retrieving or updating rows.

3.  Must have Project, Group, UserInfo, and Algorthm et. al. tables
    due to #2 above.

4.  GusRow->hasSequence specific to the implementation (which
    table_ids are Imp tables containing sequence).

5.  Evidence table will be needed in order to use the evidence methods.

6.  There may be others....


Generating Objects:

The command syntax is summarized in CreateObject.cmd.  The special cases
file is important for cases where there are multiple foreign key references
to the same table (in our case it always involves implementation tables
only specific views of which have valid attributes).  This enables the 
code generator to unambigously determine how to create the relationships.


Dependencies for GusApplication (ga)

1.  should have a .GUS_cfg file (name of which is in GUS_CFG environment variable)
    This sets the defaults for database and user so they don't have to be put onto
    the command line which in the case of the password is something that should not
    be done depending on level of security desired.

#Example file for GUSdev

gus/database            GUSdev
gus/login               <db_login>
gus/password            <db_pasword>
gus/user                brunkb
gus/group               CBIL
gus/project             GUS


ga command syntax:

ga pops the name of the plugin off the end of the argument list, thus all 
commandline options go before the plugin name which must be last. eg:

ga --help UpdateGusFromXML

ga --commit --filename <file.xml> UpdateGusFromXML
