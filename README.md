GUS4 Application Framework
=========================

GUS (Genomics Unified Schema) is a relational database schema that has been deployed in Oracle and PostgreSQL. The schema is modular and has been updated (GUS4) to better cover investigational studies, results from high (and not so high) throughput technologies, technology used, biological sequences, metadata and associated standards, pathways and networks, and data control. In particular, deep phenotyping (e.g epidemiological results) can be easily captured and interpreted through associations to ontology terms. Objectives, study design, protocols, and results are all linked in a manner consistent with established standards (MAGE-TAB, Ontology for Biomedical Investigations).
