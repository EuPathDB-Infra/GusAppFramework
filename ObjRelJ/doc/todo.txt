TO DO:
 -Deal with semantics of set/get methods for partially cached CLOB/BLOB values;
  could also be an issue when submit() is called.
 -Make sure that case-sensitivity assumptions are documented and
  that the documented behavior is strictly adhered to.
 -Correctly implement the equals() method for the various metadata
  classes (e.g. GUSTable, GUSTableAttribute, GUSTableRelation).
 -Check that tables are always identified by owner and table_name
 -Implement the build system rules to generate javadocs
 -Attribute lengths are being set incorrectly by the code generator in 
  the Table subclasses; clobs are getting 4000 instead of 4 gig, 
  varchar2 are getting length 2000 instead of 4000.
 -Replace system.(out|err).println calls with a proper logging facility
 -Make GUSRow more efficient, particularly in terms of space usage; 
  four Hashtables and two ObjectCaches per row may be excessive.
 -Move *all* of the SQL from JDBCDatabaseConnection into SQLutils

DONE:
 -Finish refactoring of ServerI, DatabaseConnectionI
 -Get the code to compile!
 -Change subclasses of GUSRow to use GUSTable.getTableByName()
 -Implement sharing of GUSTableAttribute objects; shouldn't have to create
  a new one for the "row_user_id" attribute in every table.
