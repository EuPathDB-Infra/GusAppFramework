- factor the RelationalRow stuff out of Model/GusRow.pm.

- generate should take an option to remove all non-manually edited files first

- object constructor must pass all attr values through dedicated settors

- use initXXX method for values coming from db

- use attribute name not table name as key for all relations

- setSubclassView can be generated and include xform into proper table name syntax

- avoid name collisions between subs in GusRow, etc, and generated class. (use a convention like underscore to delineate these)
