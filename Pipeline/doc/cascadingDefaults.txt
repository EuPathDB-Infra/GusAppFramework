this doc describes how cascading defaults work.


probably makes sense for each subflow to have its own config file.  it's parent config can
specify defaults for it.

more precise paths override less precise paths

# / ApiCommonData::Load::Steps::RunBlast /    -- the defaults for this kind of step, globally


# / splign.ApiCommonData::Load::Steps::RunBlast /  -- the defaults for this kind of step in
                                                      the splign workflow, wherever it appears

# / standardGenome.splign.ApiCommonData::Load::Steps::RunBlast /  -- the defaults for this kind of step in this path context


# / splign.runBlast /  -- the defaults for this particular step in the splign subflow
