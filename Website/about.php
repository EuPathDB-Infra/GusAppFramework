<h2>Overview</h2>
  <P>
  With the availability of high-throughput sequence and
  expression data, project-focused sequence databases are
  envisioned for a wide range of model organisms,
  pathogens and system-specific communities.  The Genomics
  Unified Schema (GUS) platform offers these efforts a
  sophisticated database system and user interface without
  requiring them to commit the substantial overhead and
  expertise required to build from scratch.  Individual
  sites are responsible for developing site-specific
  details.  Depending upon their needs and resources this
  will range from web page programming and data loading to
  large scale schema extensions, providing for templated
  to highly distinctive installations.  An open source CVS
  repository is used to incorporate modifications and
  extensions introduced by the external developer
  community.

  <P>
  GUS is based on an extensive strongly-typed
  relational schema and includes the GUS Application
  Framework to assist in development of data acquisition
  and analysis programs and the GUS Web Development Kit to
  assist in query-based website development.  The GUS
  platform maximizes the utility of stored data by
  warehousing it in a schema that integrates the genome,
  transcriptome, and proteome of one or more organisms,
  gene regulation and networks, ontologies and controlled
  vocabularies, gene expression and inter-organism
  comparisons.  The GUS relational database provides
  scaleable high-performance access to large amounts of
  data spread over hundreds of tables, and facilitates
  complex queries not available in many other systems.  It
  provides programmatic access via SQL and the GUS
  Application Framework.
