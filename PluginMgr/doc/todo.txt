- A nice thing to add to the GUsApplication would be command line arguments for the read/write bits in GUS.  This way all plugins would have this level of control.  We implemented oracle's Virtual Private Database functionality so that oracle logins respect the GUS read write bits for users/ groups and others so allowing users to set those read write bits when they insert using the plugins would be very nice!  -Brian

- protect ga +meta from inserting an existing revision of GusApplication

- add getSubclass($id, $superclasstablename) method to plugin.pm

DONE

- use POD for api docs.

- finish implementing the log methods: do the logging based on user's log level

- run the run() method in an eval to capture exception

- convert getSelfInv to getAlgInvocation

- convert logAlert to log

- need property for location of md5

- test existence of md5

- check the arg types provided in easy csp declaration (query db for values)
