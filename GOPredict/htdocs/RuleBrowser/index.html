	      <P>A heuristic algorithm for associating Gene
	      Ontology<sup>TM</sup> (GO) defined molecular functions to
	      protein domains as listed in ProDom and CDD is described. The
	      algorithm generates rules for function-domain associations
	      based on the intersection of functions assigned to gene
	      products by the GO consortium that contain ProDom and/or CDD
	      domains at varying levels of sequence similarity.  The
	      hierarchical nature of GO molecular functions is incorporated
	      into rule generation. Manual review of a subset of the rules
	      generated indicates an accuracy rate of 87% for ProDom rules
	      and 84% for CDD rules. The utility of these associations is
	      that novel sequences can be assigned a putative function if
	      sufficient similarity exists to a ProDom or CDD domain for
	      which one or more GO functions has been associated. Although
	      functional assignments are increasingly being made for gene
	      products from model organisms, it is likely that the needs of
	      investigators will continue to outpace the efforts of
	      curators, particularly for non-model organisms.  A comparison
	      with other methods in terms of coverage and agreement was
	      performed indicating the utility of the approach.</P>
